NAME
	blakesum - Checksum utilities for the BLAKE-family of hashing functions

SYNOPSIS
	bsum [-l bits] [-c | -B | -L | -U] [-xz] [file] ...
	b224sum [-c | -B | -L | -U] [-xz] [file] ...
	b256sum [-c | -B | -L | -U] [-xz] [file] ...
	b384sum [-c | -B | -L | -U] [-xz] [file] ...
	b512sum [-c | -B | -L | -U] [-xz] [file] ...
	b2sum [-l bits | -X bits] [-c | -B | -L | -U] [-sxz] [file] ...

DESCRIPTION
	Print or check BLAKE, BLAKE2, or BLAKE2X checksums.

	bsum is used for BLAKE2 checksums, and b2sum is used for
	BLAKE2 and BLAKE2X checksums.

	b224sum is an alias for bsum -l 224.

	b256sum is an alias for bsum -l 256.

	b384sum is an alias for bsum -l 384.

	b512sum is an alias for bsum -l 512.

OPTIONS
	The following options are supported:

	-B	Output checksums in binary representation. This
		suppresses the filenames and checksum delimiters.
		Only the checksums are printed.

	-c	Read checksums from the file and check them against
		the files on your systems. The input files files
		should be formatted as the output of the program,
		or similarly. This is not going to work if any of
		the filenames in the input files starts with <space>
		or <tab>, or if they contain a <newline>, unless the
		-z option is also used.

	-L	Output checksums in lower-case hexadecimal
		representation. (Default)

	-l bits
		For bsum:
			Select version of the BLAKE algorithm. Valid
			values are 224 (default), 256, 384, and 512.

		For b2sum:
			Select output size, valid values are multiples
			of 8 between 8 and 512, inclusively, or if
			the -s option is used between 8 and 256,
			inclusively. (Default is maximum.)

	-s	(Only available in b2sum)
		Use BLAKE2s instead of BLAKE2b.

	-U	Output checksums in upper-case hexadecimal
		representation.

	-X bits
		(Only available in b2sum)
		Use BLAKE2Xb instead of BLAKE2b or BLAKE2Xs instead
		of BLAKE2s, and select the extended output function
		output length, in bits; must be a non-zero multiple
		of 8, and no greater than 34359738360 or (if the -s
		option is used) 524280.

	-x	Convert input files from hexadecimal form to binary
		form before calculating the checksums.

	-z	Lines end with NUL instead of LF. If used with -c,
		this applies to read files (not the output), but it
		will also apply more strict parsing and allow any
		whitespace in file names.

OPERANDS
	The following operands are supported:

	file	File to read. The standard input will be used - or no
		file is specified.

EXIT STATUS
	0	Successful completion.

	1	Checksums did not match or a file did not exist.

	2	An error occurred.

NOTES
	BLAKE2X has not been finalised as of 2022-02-20.
